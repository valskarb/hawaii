        <h2>My Scratch-Off Map Story</h2>
        <p>
            For my birthday, a family member gave me a scratch-off world map.
            Every time I visit a new place, I scratch it off and reveal the color underneath.
            Over the years, I’ve scratched off many states — but Hawaii remains untouched.
            It stands out as one of the last places I have yet to explore.

        <h2>Anticipation & Future Memories</h2>
        <p>
            I don’t have memories in Hawaii yet — and that’s exactly what makes it special.
            Instead of nostalgia, I feel anticipation. I imagine walking on warm beaches,
            watching sunsets over the ocean, and experiencing the culture firsthand.
            Hawaii represents future memories waiting to happen.

        <h2>The Dream</h2>
        <p>
            One day, I will finally visit Hawaii. When I do, I’ll come home,
            scratch it off my map, and remember the journey that turned anticipation
            into real memories.
